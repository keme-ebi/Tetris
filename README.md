# Tetris

This is a tetris game made with pygame module in Python. The game aims to kill boredom and help relieve stress. This is a portfolio project done as the last project in ALX software engineering course foundation phase.

## Installation

If you'd like to install or use this code for your own learning sake, you can clone or fork the repo.
This project was done on a windows operating system using visual studio code as the code editor
Make sure pygame module is installed on your system, run `pip install pygame` in your terminal. This will install the pygame module.
After cloning or forking the repo, if you'd like to run the program:
`python -u "c:\Users\HP\name_of_folder_cloned_to\Tetris\src\main.py"`.
If you're using a code editor like visual studio codes, you can just hit the run button and it'll be done automatically for you.
Once you get the feel on how it works, if you like, for developers, you can tweak it to your liking.

## How to play

It's a simple game of tetris that carries the usual tetris rule, only that some weird or unfamiliar blocks were added to make it fun and challenging. All you have to do is stack your tetraminoes or blocks, and try to clear as much lines as possible. Clearing more than one line at once increases your score.
Use the left &#8592; arrow key to move the tetramino left, the right &#8594; arrow key to move the tetramino right, the down &#8595; to drop the tetramino, and the up &#8593; arrow key to rotate the block.
Try your best to hang in there and not fill up the tiles to the top in order to avoid _Game Over_.
To continue or restart the game after getting _Game Over_, hit the Enter/Return key &#x23CE;. The game can be paused using the spacebar
